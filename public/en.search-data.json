This NSF- and NASA-sponsored meeting hosts transdisciplinary and societally critical science focused on marine ice-sheet and adjacent Earth systems, with particular emphasis on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and how it impacts and reshapes global coastlines, including our host island‚Äôs. The 2025 meeting is hosted locally by Knut Christianson (University of Washington) and the rest of WAIS Organizing Committee (Knut Christianson, Mickey MacKie, Peter Neff, Matt Siegfried, and Tyler Sutterley).\nThe meeting begins with an icebreaker pizza dinner on Tuesday evening, September 16. Sessions are organized by topic, with keynote speakers for some sessions, followed by contributed talks and concluding with a panel discussion. Poster sessions will be held separately. We anticipate about 40-45 talks. The formal meeting agenda will end at lunch on Friday, September 19, followed by afternoon short-courses led by conmunity members for anyone interested in attending. We will also continue our annual workshop-wide community discussion as part of the scientific agenda. Please contact the WAIS Workshop organizing committee at wais@mines.edu if you are interested in leading a short course.\nClick the buttons below for more information about this year‚Äôs WAIS Workshop.\nDeadlinesImportant deadlines for WAIS Workshop 2025 RegistrationInformation about registration and lodging fees AbstractsAbstract submission information Early-Career Travel SupportInformation about travel support for early-career researchers (\u003c5 years since PhD) AgendaPreliminary information about the workshop agenda Travel \u0026 TransportationSome extra information to help with travel and transportation Presentation GuidelinesInitial guidelines for oral and poster presentations Code of ConductInformation on the workshop‚Äôs code of conduct "},"title":"2025 WAIS Workshop"},"/current-meeting/abstract-submission/":{"data":{"":"Abstract submission for the 2025 WAIS Workshop has not opened yet.

The workshop is 2¬Ω days, concluding with lunch on Friday, September 19. We will have around 40‚Äì45 talks that cover all aspects of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet system or other marine ice-sheet systems, including research from glaciologists, oceanographers, atmospheric scientists, biologists, computer scientists, and engineers at all career stages. Following each set of oral presentations, a panel (the session‚Äôs speakers) and the moderator will lead an open discussion about the general theme, and examine what the significance of new insights presented in the talks is for WAIS and other marine ice-sheet systems. This open, engaged discussion helps identify the core research directiosn for our community.\nIn addition to talks, WAIS will have space for about 30-40 posters. There will be an opportunity to give a very brief overview of a poster topic to the audience just prior to the poster sessions. Posters receive a great deal of attention at WAIS Workshop and frequently launch new research directions.\n2025 Science Sessions For 2025, we have six thematic science sessions. If you do not feel like your research fits into one these sessions, never fear: the WAIS Workshop Organizing Committees takes these sessions as a suggestion and will reorganize presentationsn and sessions as needed. The sessions for 2025 WAIS Workshop are:\nWAIS and marine ice sheets across timescales: Marine ice sheets change on timescales ranging from seconds to millenia. How do we observe and integrate research and scientific discoveries across several disciplines in support of big-picture, scientific pursuits in West Antarctica? We seek contributions for multi-disciplinary and integrative topics that are important to WAIS and marine ice sheet dynamics such as atmosphere-ice-ocean-bed-ecosystem interactions, linkages of surface and basal processes, and connections between modern-day observations and the paleo record. Notes from the Underground: The future of marine ice-sheets depends on what is happening within and underneath the ice. What are the new observational and modeling tools that have recently or are soon to come on line that enable us to peer within and beneath WAIS? Connect Four: Ice, Ocean, Atmosphere, Rock: New discoveries and insights relating to the atmospheric (such as surface mass balance, firn processes, extraordinary snow events, and atmospheric rivers), the ocean (such as grounding line processes, ice-shelf stability, connections to sea ice conditions, sub-ice-shelf processes), rock (such as glacial isostatic adjustment, geothermal heat, erosion), and their interconnected ice-atmospheric-ocean-rock system. We seek contributions that look at connections and feedbacks between these key systems‚Äîpast, present and future‚Äîto help us understand modern and future change in West Antarctica, including insights from other glaciers and ice sheets that may inform our understanding of WAIS. What does the future hold? Projections of marine-ice sheet contribution to sea level continue to be (somewhat infamously) subjected to ‚Äúdeep uncertainty‚Äù. What are the current projections? How do we quantify and communicate uncertainty in a complex, interconnected, multidisciplinary, non-linear system? What processes are still missing from these projections and how do they impact global coastal change? What are the key pathways for defining, quantifying, reducing, accepting, and communicating uncertainty in the marine ice-sheet system? What Did I Miss? We invite contributions about research that highlights data and modeling gaps that limit our ability to advance our understanding of any or all components of the Antarctic system. What are the community needs for future satellite, airborne, and ground measurements? How do we easily access and analyze the growing volume of model output? WAIS impacts across the US: Actionable science about the impact of WAIS and marine ice-sheet change requires engaging federal, state, and local governments and populations across the country to co-produce knowledge and solutions. We seek contributions that describe efforts to bring WAIS science into the general population and promote funding opportunities for our research. We particularly appreciate case studies from outside the US, which can provide strategies to implement domestically.

There is a ferry crossing from Mukilteo to Clinton that doesn‚Äôt require reservations, but only runs every 30 minutes or so and can get crowded during mornings and afternoons with long wait times. The other route entails driving north to Ana Cortes and crossing there, then driving south along the spine of Whidbey Island, which is a nice drive and includes a quite-scenic portion through Deception Pass State Park (camping also available here). We of course strongly suggest carpooling and, as in years past, we have an electronic ride-sharing board for those who wish to carpool to and from the airport.\nAlternatively, SeaTac Shuttle offers shuttles 9 times a day (roughly every 2 hours) between the airport and Coupeville on Whidbey Island for $57 one way or $114 round trip. Reservations must be made at least 24 hours in advance; you can book on their website. They will drop you off in downtown Coupeville, and you can grab a taxi or use the free Island Transit buses (route 6 southbound from Coupeville Park \u0026 Ride to Coupeville Ferry) to get to Camp Casey.

WAIS Workshops document the wholesale change in perspective to the present, where West Antarctica and other marine-based sectors of Antarctica represented a substantial fraction of annual sea level change as well as one of the largest uncertainties for future coastal impacts.\nThis history archive should be owned by the community, and so we have made all documents freely available and easily accessible through our GitHub repository.

MSP is approximately 2 hour drive from our conference venue, whereas DLH is approximately a 40 minute drive. As in years past, we have an electronic ride-sharing board for those wishing to carpool to or from the airport (we highly recommend carpooling!). In addition to carpooling, we hope to reserve a van or two for larger shuttles from MSP and/or Duluth; more information on shared vanpools will be available for registrants in early September."},"title":"Travel and Transportation"},"/past-meetings/2024/":{"data":{"":" 2024 WAIS Workshop Thirty-First Annual WAIS Workshop November 11-14, 2024\nHilton UF Conference Center\nGainesville, FL USA\nClick here for the conference booklet, including the agenda and abstracts. The 2024 WAIS Workshop was held in Gainesville, Florida, at the Hilton UF Conference Center, located on the University of Florida campus. This NSF- and NASA-sponsored meeting hosts transdisciplinary and societally critical science focused on marine ice-sheet and adjacent Earth systems, with particular emphasis on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and how it will impact global coastlines, including our host state‚Äôs. The 2024 meeting is hosted locally by Mickey MacKie (University of Florida) and the rest of WAIS Organizing Committee (Knut Christianson, Brooke Medley, Lauren Miller, Peter Neff, and Matt Siegfried). The 2024 abstract booklet and agenda, with links to videos of each presentation, can be found here. You can re-watch the whole meeting via YouTube here.\nThe meeting began with an icebreaker pizza dinner on Monday evening, November 11. Sessions were organized by topic, with keynote speakers for some sessions, followed by contributed talks and concluding with a panel discussion. Poster sessions were held separately. We anticipate about 40-45 talks. The formal meeting agenda endedat lunch on Thursday, November 14, followed by afternoon short-courses led by conmunity members for anyone interested in attending.\nDeadlinesSee important dealines RegistrationSee the registration information AbstractsAbstract submission information Early-Career Travel SupportInformation about travel support for early career researched (\u003c5 years since PhD) AgendaPreliminary information about the workshop agenda Travel \u0026 TransportationSome extra information to help with travel and transportation Presentation GuidelinesInitial guidelines for oral and poster presentations Code of ConductInformation about the workshop code of conduct.

Plan to arrive Monday, November 11 for dinner and socializing; dinner is included in the registration fee and we ask for a small donation to cover drinks. The WAIS Workshop is 2¬Ω days, with the formal program concluding with lunch on Thursday, November 14. We will have around 40‚Äì45 talks that cover all aspects of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet system or other marine ice-sheet systems, including research from glaciologists, oceanographers, atmospheric scientists, biologists, computer scientists, and engineers at all career stages. We also enourage abstracts that discuss relevant aspects of communicating WAIS science beyond the research community, particularly those that cover impacts of WAIS change on society, as well as ideas to improve the diversity, inclusion, and equity of our field. Following each set of oral presentations, a panel of the session‚Äôs speakers and a moderator will lead an open discussion about the general theme, and examine what the significance of new insights presented in the talks is for the West Antarctic system. For 2024, sessions themes will include:\nWAIS in the Community: Actionable science about the impact of WAIS and marine ice-sheet change requires civic engagement and co-production of knowledge with people outside the confines of academic and research institutions. We seek contributions that describe efforts to provide insight on and examples of community development that mutually benefit all parties involved as well as contributions that promote the development of inclusive and equitable research and learning spaces.\nNew Technology \u0026 FAIR Science: Answering the pressing questions at the end of the Earth requires innovation for both the technology we use and the open-science ecosystem in which we work. What are the new technologies that have recently or soon will come on line that will enable steps forward in the generation of WAIS scientific knowledge? How do we develop open science frameworks to accelerate our science?\nAtmosphere \u0026 Ocean Drivers: New discoveries and insights relating to the atmospheric, such as surface mass balance, firn processes, extraordinary snow events, and atmospheric rivers, and the ocean, such as grounding line processes, ice-shelf stability, connections to sea ice conditions, sub-ice-shelf processes, and their interconnected atmospheric-ice-ocean system. We seek contributions that look at these key drivers‚Äîpast, present and future‚Äîto help us understand modern and future change in West Antarctica, including insights from other glaciers and ice sheets that may inform our understanding of WAIS.\nObservational \u0026 Modeling Gaps: We invite contributions about research that highlights data gaps that limit our ability to advance our understanding of any or all components of the Antarctic system. What are the community needs for future satellite, airborne, and ground measurements? How do we easily access and analyze the growing volume of model output?\nPiecing the Puzzle Together: We seek submissions that integrate research and scientific discoveries across several disciplines in support of big-picture, scientific pursuits in West Antarctica, such as atmosphere-ice-ocean-bed-ecosystem interactions, linkages of surface and basal processes, modern-day connections with the paleo ice core and geologic record, and other multi-disciplinary, integrative topics that are important to WAIS and marine ice sheet dynamics.\nUncertainty Quantification: Ice sheet processes are (now famously) subjected to ‚Äúdeep uncertainty‚Äù. How do we quantify and communicate uncertainty in a complex, interconnected, multidisciplinary, non-linear system? What are the key pathways for our community to define, quantify, reduce, accept, and communicate uncertainty in the marine ice-sheet system?\nIn addition to talks, WAIS Workshop will have space for posters. There will be an opportunity to give a very brief overview of a poster topic to the audience just prior to the poster sessions. Posters have historically received a great deal of attention at WAIS Workshops."},"title":"Agenda"},"/past-meetings/2024/code-of-conduct/":{"data":{"":"The WAIS Workshop is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, religion, or other protected status.
