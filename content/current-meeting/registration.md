Lodging at [Camp Casey](https://www.ymcacampcasey.org/) is in rustic quarters on the Puget Sound. Staying on site allows interaction and collaboration among the meeting participants in an informal and beautiful setting. For the true WAIS Workshop experience, we _strongly_ recommend staying on-site. Lodging will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, and we do have space available for all participants to stay on site in shared quarters. 

For those preferring a hotel, there are several options nearby in Oakville, WA ([about 20–25 minutes away by car](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MVxkMp4DNyFHa68n6)); we have not arranged a room block, so you are on your own for lodging and transportation to/from Camp Casey every day if you choose not to stay on site. 

## Refund Policy

Registration types can be changed with any price difference refunded (or charged) to the attendee until the registration close date on August 13. Registration can be canceled and refunded with \$100 fee until September 2, after which there will be no refunds. If there are any questions, please contact us. 

## WAIS Workshop Livestream

A note about the virtual livestream: The 2025 WAIS Workshop will have a free livestream option that will allow viewing all talks and discussions free of charge, with an opportunity to submit questions/comments for presenters and panelists digitally. Additional details, including links, will be sent to the [WAIS Workshop email list](https://waisworkshop.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=899f758df5f1161ee9a993d3e&id=489522cb53). Like in years past, all sessions except our Community Health session will be recorded and archived on YouTube after the conference.
