## Travel to Camp Casey

We recommend you fly into Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, and either carpool or use an airport shuttle service:

Seattle-Tacoma International airport is ~2 to 2Â½ hours by car (Google Maps directions [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7tmGWZsWtQqs75HW8)), depending on traffic and timing the ferry route (if one chooses to take the ferry). There is a ferry crossing from Mukilteo to Clinton that doesn't require reservations, but only runs every 30 minutes or so and can get crowded during mornings and afternoons with long wait times. The other route entails driving north to Ana Cortes and crossing there, then driving south along the spine of Whidbey Island, which is a nice drive and includes a quite-scenic portion through Deception Pass State Park (camping also available here). We of course strongly suggest carpooling and, as in years past, we have an electronic ride-sharing board for those who wish to carpool to and from the airport, which you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19vRReQ_D9ecxullR45xSt_lsZCZuSgdDBjbWr13Dhk4/edit?gid=1066643325#gid=1066643325). Please carpool!

Alternatively, SeaTac Shuttle offers shuttles 9 times a day (roughly every 2 hours) between the airport and Coupeville on Whidbey Island for $57 one way or $114 round trip. Reservations must be made at least 24 hours in advance; you can book on [their website](http://www.seatacshuttle.com/). They will drop you off in downtown Coupeville, and you can grab a taxi or use the free Island Transit buses ([route 6 southbound from Coupeville Park & Ride to Coupeville Ferry](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1dwrxfee4yEaBxHo6)) to get to Camp Casey. You also can ask the drive if they are willing to drive you the extra 7 minutes to Camp Casey. Be sure to look at the shuttle times *before* you book your flights if you are planning on taking the shuttle.
