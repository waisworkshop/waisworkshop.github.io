The 2025 WAIS Workshop will return to Coupville, WA on Whidbey Island at the [YMCA Camp Casey](https://www.ymcacampcasey.org/). This NSF- and NASA-sponsored meeting hosts transdisciplinary and societally critical science focused on marine ice-sheet and adjacent Earth systems, with particular emphasis on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and how it impacts and reshapes global coastlines, including our host island's. The 2025 meeting is hosted locally by Knut Christianson (University of Washington) and the rest of WAIS Organizing Committee (Knut Christianson, Mickey MacKie, Peter Neff, Matt Siegfried, and Tyler Sutterley). 

The meeting begins with an icebreaker pizza dinner on Tuesday evening, September 16. Sessions are organized by topic, with keynote speakers for some sessions, followed by contributed talks and concluding with a panel discussion. Poster sessions will be held separately. We anticipate about 40-45 talks. The formal meeting agenda will end at lunch on Friday, September 19, followed by afternoon short-courses led by conmunity members for anyone interested in attending. We will also continue our annual workshop-wide community discussion as part of the scientific agenda. Please contact the WAIS Workshop organizing committee at [wais@mines.edu](mailto:wais@mines.edu) if you are interested in leading a short course.
