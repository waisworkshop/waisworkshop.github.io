**Abstracts can be submitted via [our abstract portal](https://mines.eventsair.com/26gp1120a/abstracts).** Please use the same login information as your registration. This will connect your registration to your abstract and allow you to edit your abstract later if you need to. Abstracts are limited to 500 words and submission (and post-submission edits) will close August 13 at 11:59 PDT (UTC-7). 

See our [Agenda](../agenda) page for 2025 science sessions and our [Presentation Guidelines](../presentation-guidelines) page for more details about the presentation types at the 2025 WAIS Workshop.
