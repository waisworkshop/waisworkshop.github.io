## Original Text

--->

Plan to arrive Tuesday, September 16 for a light dinner and socializing. The workshop is 2½ days, concluding with lunch on Friday, September 19. We will have around 40–45 talks that cover all aspects of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet system or other marine ice-sheet systems, including research from glaciologists, oceanographers, atmospheric scientists, biologists, computer scientists, and engineers at all career stages. Following each set of oral presentations, a panel (the session's speakers) and the moderator will lead an open discussion about the general theme, and examine what the significance of new insights presented in the talks is for WAIS and other marine ice-sheet systems. This open, engaged discussion helps identify the core research directiosn for our community.

In addition to talks, WAIS will have space for about 30-40 posters. There will be an opportunity to give a very brief overview of a poster topic to the audience just prior to the poster sessions. Posters receive a great deal of attention at WAIS Workshop and frequently launch new research directions. 

Stay tuned for a detailed agenda after abstract submission closes.
