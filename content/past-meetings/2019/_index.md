The 2019 WAIS Workshop will be held outside of sunny San Diego, California, at the newly upgraded and remodeled [Camp Cedar Glen](http://www.campcedarglen.org/) in Julian, CA. This NSF- and NASA-sponsored meeting hosts transdisciplinary and societally critical science focused on marine ice-sheet and adjacent earth systems, with particular emphasis on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Similar to past years, registration and abstraction submission will open in early July and the abstract deadline will be in August. The WAIS Workshop will immediately follow the [2019 Interdisciplinary Antarctic Earth Sciences meeting](http://tamcamp.org/) from October 13-15, also at Camp Cedar Glen. The 2019 meeting is hosted locally by Helen Fricker and the WAIS Organizing Committee (Knut Christianson, Indrani Das, Joseph MacGregor, Brooke Medley, Matthew Siegfried, Lauren Simkins). 

The meeting begins with an Icebreaker pizza dinner on Tuesday evening, October 15. Sessions are organized by topic, with keynote speakers for some sessions, followed by contributed talks and concluding with a panel discussion. Poster sessions will be held separately. We anticipate about 40-50 talks. The formal meeting agenda will end at lunch on Friday, October 18, followed by a workshop to bring together community college educators and the WAIS research community. Also new for this year, we will have an opt-in mentoring program for any early-career WAIS Workshop attendees and a workshop-wide discussion about issues surrounding fieldwork conduct.
