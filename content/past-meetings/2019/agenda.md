Plan to arrive Tuesday, October 15 for dinner and socializing; dinner is included in the registration fee and we ask for a small donation to cover drinks. The WAIS Workshop is 2Â½ days, concluding with lunch on Friday, October 18. We will have around 40-50 talks that cover all aspects of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet system, including research from glaciologists, oceanographers, atmospheric scientists, biologists, computer scientists, and engineers at all career stages. We also enourage abstracts that discuss relevant aspects of communicating WAIS science beyond the research community as well as ideas to improve the diversity, inclusion, and equity of our field. Following each set of oral presentations, a panel of the session's speakers and a moderator will lead an open discussion about the general theme, and examine what the significance of new insights presented in the talks is for the West Antarctic system. For 2019, sessions topics will include: 

* **Will the snowflakes save us?** Near-surface science in West Antarctica using shallow geophysics, ice cores, firn studies, atmospheric reanalysis, meteorological observations, and modeling
* **Processes Beneath:** Deep geophysics, direct-access experiments, microbiology, sediment coring, and modeling for quantifying critical processes from the basal interface to the core
* **The Great Glacier Conveyer - A John Nye & Wally Broecker Appreciation Session:** Connecting paleo understanding with modern processes
* **From The Sea:** Polar oceanography, tropical teleconnections, marine life, and ice front dynamics and their impact on a changing WAIS
* **The Leading Edge:** New boundary conditions, new modeling techniques, Operation IceBridge, ICESat-2, GRACE, GRACE-FO, NISAR, and data science applications for West Antarctic science
* **Dynamics across the grounding line:** Past, present, and future understanding of the ice stream-grounding zone-ice shelf transition seen from the ground, air, satellites, and models
* **Science Communication:** Taking WAIS science beyond our room
* **Community Health:** Avoiding, acknowledging, and approaching issues with field harassment

In addition to talks, WAIS Workshop will have space for posters. There will be an opportunity to give a very brief overview of a poster topic to the audience just prior to the poster sessions. Posters have historically received a great deal of attention at WAIS Workshops.
