## Talk Guidelines

* Talks will be 5, 10, or 15 minutes long, including time for questions and switching presenters. You can select your preference on the registration page, though the Organizing Committee will make the final allocation during the agenda creaion process. We have a full meeting so please be mindful of your time and courteous to the next presenter. A discussion period concludes each session where further questions can be addressed.
* All presentation files will be loaded on one central laptop to expedite the transition between presenters. We request you provide us with your presentation the *day prior* to your assigned time. Dinner time is a good time for this.
* Powerpoint or PDF files are preferred. Keynote is available.
* After the conference, presentations will be posted with the agenda on the WAIS Workshop site. If you prefer we don't publish your presentation, e-mail the Organizing Committee at: [wais@mines.edu](mailto:wais@mines.edu).
* For 2019, all talks will be livestreamed for those that cannot attend the conference. If you have concerns about livestreaming your talk, please contact the WAIS Workshop Organizing Committee. These livestreams will be recorded and archived on our website.


## Poster Guidelines

* Preceding each poster session will be a brief opportunity for each day's poster presenters to give a one-minute pitch about their research.
* For space efficiency, posters cannot exceed 4 feet in height or width.
