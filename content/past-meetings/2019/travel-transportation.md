We recommend you fly into San Diego International Airport, which is located about 1.5 hours by car from the venue. Directions are located on the [Camp Cedar Glen](http://www.campcedarglen.org/gettoknowus/300-2) website.

We will offer a Ride-sharing Board for carpooling between the airport and the venue and/or hotel. Registered attendees will be sent the link to the ride sharing board in early September.
