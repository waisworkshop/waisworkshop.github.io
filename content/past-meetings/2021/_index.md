The 2021 WAIS Workshop was held in Sterling, Virginia, in the Washington, DC area at [Algonkian Regional Park](https://www.novaparks.com/parks/algonkian-regional-park). This NSF- and NASA-sponsored meeting hosts transdisciplinary and societally critical science focused on marine ice-sheet and adjacent earth systems, with particular emphasis on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The 2021 meeting is hosted locally by Lauren Simkins (University of Virginia), Brooke Medley (NASA Goddard), and the rest of WAIS Organizing Committee (Knut Christianson, Indrani Das, Peter Neff, Matthew Siegfried). 

The meeting begins with an icebreaker pizza dinner on Monday evening, September 20. Sessions are organized by topic, with keynote speakers for some sessions, followed by contributed talks and concluding with a panel discussion. Poster sessions will be held separately. We anticipate about 40-50 talks. The formal meeting agenda will end at lunch on Thursday, September 23, followed by a workshop to bring together community college educators and the WAIS research community. We will also continue our opt-in mentoring program for any early-career WAIS Workshop attendees and a workshop-wide discussion about community health.
