## 2021 Meeting Agenda

The full agenda with times, presenters, and abstracts can be found [here](/agendas2021booklet.pdf)

Plan to arrive Monday, September 20 for dinner and socializing; dinner is included in the registration fee and we ask for a small donation to cover drinks. The WAIS Workshop is 2Â½ days, concluding with lunch on Thursday, September 23. We will have around 40-50 talks that cover all aspects of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet system, including research from glaciologists, oceanographers, atmospheric scientists, biologists, computer scientists, and engineers at all career stages. We also enourage abstracts that discuss relevant aspects of communicating WAIS science beyond the research community as well as ideas to improve the diversity, inclusion, and equity of our field. Following each set of oral presentations, a panel of the session's speakers and a moderator will lead an open discussion about the general theme, and examine what the significance of new insights presented in the talks is for the West Antarctic system. For 2021, sessions topics will include:

* **Piecing the puzzle together:** Multi-disciplinary, integrative science in West Antarctica.
* **Beyond MISI:** Novel insights into Antarctic ice sheet processes.
* **Marine ice sheet sensitivity in the Earth system.**
* **Greetings from the future:** Innovations in observing and modeling techniques.
* **WAIS in the community:** Civic engagement & co-production of deliverables.
* **Community Health.**

In addition to talks, WAIS Workshop will have space for posters. There will be an opportunity to give a very brief overview of a poster topic to the audience just prior to the poster sessions. Posters have historically received a great deal of attention at WAIS Workshops.
