## WAIS Workshop Archive: 1992 – present

WAIS Workshop agendas and abstract booklets represent an annual snapshot of the evolution of West Antarctic (and other marine-based ice-sheet sectors) research from 1992 to the present. The [first WAIS Workshop](past-meetings/1992) occured soon after the release of the International Panel on Climate Change First Assessment Report ([IPCC AR1](https://archive.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/far/wg_I/ipcc_far_wg_I_full_report.pdf)) in 1990, when the reported consensus was that major outflow of ice from West Antarctica due to climate change was "not likely" over the next century. WAIS Workshops document the wholesale change in perspective to the present, where West Antarctica and other marine-based sectors of Antarctica represented a substantial fraction of annual sea level change as well as one of the largest uncertainties for future coastal impacts. 

This history archive should be owned by the community, and so we have made all documents freely available and easily accessible through [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/waisworkshop/waisworkshop.github.io). We hope to slowly update the archive to make all information machine readable for large-scale analysis of WAIS Workshop science. 

If you have information about WAIS Workshops that does not appear in our archive, please get in touch! You can email us at [wais@mines.edu](mailto:wais@mines.edu) or open a GitHub Issue on [the repository for this website](https://github.com/waisworkshop/waisworkshop.github.io). 

Starting in 2019, all WAIS Workshops were recorded. Links to these recordings can be found in each year's webpage.
