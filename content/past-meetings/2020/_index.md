# 2020 WAIS Workshop

Thank you for attending the Virtual West Antarctic Ice Sheet Workshop 2020!

Due to on-going COVID19 pandemic, the 2020 WAIS Workshop was a distributed, virtual conference. And instead of having three days of WAIS Workshop activities, we had three weeks of WAIS Workshop content to enjoy.
