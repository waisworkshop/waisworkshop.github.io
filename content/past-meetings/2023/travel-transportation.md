We recommend you fly into either Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport (MSP) or Duluth International Airport (DLH). MSP is approximately 2 hour drive from our conference venue, whereas DLH is approximately a 40 minute drive. As in years past, we have an [electronic ride-sharing board](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hT_wEKBWLOaky35aKjQqJrfc0oVXS4uezgb4S9OMG2Y/edit?usp=sharing) for those wishing to carpool to or from the airport (we highly recommend carpooling!). In addition to carpooling, we hope to reserve a van or two for larger shuttles from MSP and/or Duluth; more information on shared vanpools will be available for registrants in early September.
