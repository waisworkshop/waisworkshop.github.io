The 2023 WAIS Workshop will be held in Cloquet, MN, at University of Minnesota's [Cloquet Forestry Center](https://cfc.cfans.umn.edu/), a research and education site located on the southern edge of North America's boreal forestâ€”[read more here](./about-cfc) about University of Minnesota intentions for the Cloquet Forestry Center in consultation with the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa leaders. This NSF- and NASA-sponsored meeting hosts transdisciplinary and societally critical science focused on marine ice-sheet and adjacent earth systems, with particular emphasis on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The 2023 meeting is hosted locally by Peter Neff (University of Minnesota) and the rest of WAIS Organizing Committee (Knut Christianson, Mickey MacKie, Brooke Medley, Matt Siegfried, Lauren Simkins). 

The meeting begins with an icebreaker pizza dinner on Monday evening, September 25. Sessions are organized by topic, with keynote speakers for some sessions, followed by contributed talks and concluding with a panel discussion. Poster sessions will be held separately. We anticipate about 40-50 talks. The formal meeting agenda will end at lunch on Thursday, September 28, followed by a set of workshops open for any WAIS Workshop attendee. We will also continue our workshop-wide discussion about community health as part of the scientific agenda.
