At the request of Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa leaders, the University of Minnesota has been engaged in regular and ongoing dialogue about the Cloquet Forestry Center, which is wholly located within the Fond du Lac Reservation. While these conversations have included the possibility of returning the land, they have also focused on information about the University of Minnesota research being conducted on the land, how these research efforts may align with the research needs of the Band, program development and community engagement, history of the property and cultural uses, and more.

These conversations have led to an initial plan to move forward collaboratively — with the Fond du Lac, the University and the State of Minnesota — to return to the Band the approximately 3,400 acres that house the Cloquet Forestry Center. There are still a number of steps that must be taken before a clear timeline for a transfer of ownership can be developed. Such a transfer would require the State to help facilitate. In addition, more consideration and negotiation are necessary to consider the effects this plan would have on the University’s research portfolio. Further details will be shared when they are finalized.

With full understanding that there will be many questions about this plan and that some cannot currently be answered, this [FAQ provides additional details](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-f2krp3S1iDWrwPX4zU9bXv4SXobX9ud/view) about the history and context surrounding this decision and potential next steps.
