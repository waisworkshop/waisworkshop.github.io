The retreat format of WAIS Workshops provides a unique atmosphere where scientists at the start of their career can interact with senior researchers. We therefore strive to make WAIS Workshop accessible through early-career travel support to encourage attendence from a broad specturm of early-career researchers. 

Our budget includes airfare registration fee support for a limited number of students and early-career researchers. We ask that interested people submit an abstract on their recent research for consideration for the funding and submit the application for early-career travel support [here](http://forms.gle/vLPUZBE2ijxMLQtU7). 

We estimate that we have travel support for 10 students or recent post-doctoral researchers (≤ 5 years since degree, or ≤ 5 years in career in total if there was a break due to family obligations). 

Please highlight the relevance of your abstract to West Antarctica, ice sheet stability, ice-ocean or ice-biology interactions, or polar climate change and any other relevant information regarding your funding. 

We will aim to inform students of the decision on their support by October 4 to allow time to purchase tickets and register; deadline to request funds is September 19.
