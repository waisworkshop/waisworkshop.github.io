The 2022 WAIS Workshop will be held in Estes Park, Colorado, at the [YMCA of the Rockies](https://ymcarockies.org/), right next to Rocky Mountain National Park. This NSF- and NASA-sponsored meeting hosts transdisciplinary and societally critical science focused on marine ice-sheet and adjacent earth systems, with particular emphasis on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The 2022 meeting is hosted locally by Matt Siegfried (Colorado School of Mines) and the rest of WAIS Organizing Committee (Knut Christianson, Indrani Das, Brooke Medley, Peter Neff, Lauren Simkins). 

The meeting begins with an icebreaker pizza dinner on Monday evening, September 26. Sessions are organized by topic, with keynote speakers for some sessions, followed by contributed talks and concluding with a panel discussion. Poster sessions will be held separately. You can view the detailed agenda in our abstract booklet [here](/abstracts/wais2022booklet.pdf). The formal meeting agenda will end at lunch on Thursday, September 29, followed by a workshop to bring together community college educators and the WAIS research community. We will also continue our opt-in mentoring program for any early-career WAIS Workshop attendees and a workshop-wide discussion about community health.
