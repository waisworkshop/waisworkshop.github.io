# WAIS Workshop Website & Archive

Welcome to the new home of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Workshop and its archive of over 30 years of in-progress West Antarctic (and other sectors of marine-based ice) research. Our website was transitioned to GitHub in 2025 to make sure it belongs to the research community, but as you can likely see, the website (and in particular the archive of past meetings) is still under development. If you have suggestions for improvements or additional pieces of WAIS Workshop history that are available, please open a GitHub issue or edit the website directly following the directions below. You can also email us at [wais@mines.edu](mailto:wais@mines.edu).

## Updating the website

The WAIS Workshop website is generated with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) using the [Hextra theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hextra/) and deployed via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). If you are interested in directly suggesting changes, feel free to fork this repository and make a new branch. When you clone your repository locally, be sure to use the flag `--recursive` to ensure the submodules are cloned as well. Once it is local, you can deploy a local copy of the website to view the website with your local edits by running `hugo server`. Once you have editted the website, please submit a pull request to merge your branch into the live website.
